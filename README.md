# sign-up-form
This repository consists of a project aimed to create a webpage representing a sign up form for creating a new account on a website.  This was done as part of the curriculum for the Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript course ( https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css/lessons/sign-up-form )
